        </center>
        <p style="color: honeydew;">The peacock is well known for its bright feathers, which it often shows off in a magnificent courting display. A
        peafowl's appearance varies slightly depending on the species. The Indian peacock has very flashy plumage, with a bright
        blue head and neck, which they use to attract a mate.</p>
        <p style="color: honeydew;">Peacock is the national bird of India, which is renowned for its exquisite beauty and historical importance. It is a
        delightful sight to witness the dance of the Peacock during the rain. Peacock is the Pride of our nation, and its beauty
        is famous worldwide.</p>
        <p style="color: honeydew;">A peacock is a shiny blue bird who fans out his large colorful iridescent tail feathers, especially when he's flirting
        with the peahens. A peacock is a male peafowl. A male peacock is more flamboyant than his female counterpart â€” he's the
        one with those long brilliant tail feathers marked with eye-like designs.</p>
        <p style="color: honeydew;">ts train of metallic green tail feathers is about 60 inches (150 centimeters) long. Each tail feather has a shining spot
        at the end of the feather that looks like an eye. A crest, or tuft of feathers, tops the male's head. The body feathers
        of the male blue peacock are mostly blue-green.</p>
        <p style="color: honeydew;">It has a ton of live sports, including select NFL games and every Premier League match, a vast library of decades of
        high-quality movies and shows, and a stealthily strong lineup of originals. Those originals are our main focus today.</p>
        <p style="color: honeydew;">The peacock is the most beautiful bird in the world. It is a tall but slender bird with a long feather tail. The bird
        has different shades of blue and green feathers. Peacocks can spread out their long feathers like an umbrella revealing
        hundreds of eye-like patterns.</p>
